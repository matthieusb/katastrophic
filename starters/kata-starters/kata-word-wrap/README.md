## Rules

You write a **class called Wrapper, that has a single static function named wrap** that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number. The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number.

Like a word processor, break the line by replacing the last space in a line with a newline.

## Pre-requisites
